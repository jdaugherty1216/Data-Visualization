# Data-Visualization

## Introduction

This project centers around building data visualizations and a data dashbooard in Tableau. The data used in this project comes from a Kaggle dataset, it tracks the on-time performance of US domestic flights operated by large air carriers in 2015.

The goal of the dashboard is to create a way for the user to easily use the delay data to make an educated choice on airline choices based upon historical data for delays.

## What is the average duration of each delay type?
